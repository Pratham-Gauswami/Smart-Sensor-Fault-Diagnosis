Smart Sensor Fault Diagnosis & Knowledge Graph System
Overview
The Smart Sensor Fault Diagnosis & Knowledge Graph System is a preventive maintenance pipeline designed to enhance fault detection and resolution in industrial sensor networks. This system processes structured sensor readings and unstructured log data, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) for entity extraction, a Neo4j knowledge graph for relationship mapping, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows to deliver actionable fault diagnosis and repair recommendations.
Features

Data Processing: Ingests and processes structured sensor data (e.g., time-series readings) and unstructured logs (e.g., error messages, maintenance notes).
Entity Extraction: Utilizes NLP techniques to extract key entities such as sensor IDs, fault types, and timestamps from unstructured logs.
Knowledge Graph: Maps relationships between sensors, faults, and maintenance actions using a Neo4j graph database for efficient querying and insights.
RAG Workflow: Integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation to provide context-aware fault diagnosis and repair recommendations.
Preventive Maintenance: Enables proactive fault detection and resolution, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

Architecture
The system follows a modular pipeline:

Data Ingestion: Collects structured sensor data (e.g., CSV, JSON) and unstructured logs (e.g., text files).
NLP Processing: Uses libraries like spaCy or BERT for entity extraction and text preprocessing.
Knowledge Graph Construction: Stores entities and relationships in a Neo4j database, enabling complex queries (e.g., "Which sensors frequently fail together?").
RAG Integration: Combines retrieved knowledge graph data with a generative model to produce actionable recommendations.
Output: Generates diagnostic reports and repair suggestions for maintenance teams.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
NLP Libraries: spaCy, Transformers (Hugging Face), or similar
Graph Database: Neo4j
RAG Framework: LangChain or custom implementation
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
APIs/Interfaces: Optional REST API for integration with external systems
Deployment: Docker (optional for containerized deployment)

Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Neo4j Desktop or Community Edition
Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

Steps

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/smart-sensor-fault-diagnosis.git
cd smart-sensor-fault-diagnosis


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Set Up Neo4j:

Download and install Neo4j.
Configure the database credentials in config/neo4j_config.yaml.


Configure Environment:

Copy .env.example to .env and update with your settings (e.g., API keys, database credentials).


Run the Pipeline:
python main.py



Usage

Prepare Input Data:

Place structured sensor data (e.g., .csv) in the data/structured/ directory.
Place unstructured logs (e.g., .txt) in the data/unstructured/ directory.


Run the Pipeline:

Execute python main.py to process data, build the knowledge graph, and generate recommendations.
Outputs are saved in the outputs/ directory as diagnostic reports.


Query the Knowledge Graph:

Use the Neo4j Browser to explore relationships (e.g., MATCH (s:Sensor)-[:HAS_FAULT]->(f:Fault) RETURN s, f).
Alternatively, use provided scripts in scripts/neo4j_queries.py.


View Recommendations:

Check the outputs/recommendations/ directory for generated fault diagnosis and repair suggestions.



Example
from pipeline import SensorFaultPipeline

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = SensorFaultPipeline(

    neo4j_uri="bolt://localhost:7687",
    neo4j_user="neo4j",
    neo4j_password="password"
)

# Run the pipeline
pipeline.run()
