04a_feature_extarction_multiDomain.py

ðŸ§© What this script does step by step
Loads your processed_dataset.pkl
This is the file from your previous phase that already combines metadata + waveform arrays.
Normalizes each signal (z-score)
Ensures amplitude differences donâ€™t distort comparisons.
Computes statistical features
Mean
Standard deviation
Skewness (asymmetry of waveform)
Kurtosis (peakedness)
Max/Min amplitude values
Computes frequency-domain features
Peak frequency (FFT index of highest amplitude)
Total energy in the signal
Aggregates and saves features
Each row represents one waveform segment with its extracted features and metadata labels.
â†’ Output files are ready for ML modeling or visualization.
